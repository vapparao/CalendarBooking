# My Feedback

I focused on making the solution function as per the requirements and I have used best practices in chosing packages and organizing code
I used

- Dependency Inversion Pattern for managing dependencies
- Repository Pattern for data access
- Dapper light weight micro ORM for data access (CRUD)
- Used Serilog for effective logging
- Used Nodatime for datetime calculations

I have written adequate unitests to make sure the solution is functioning in accordance with the given requirements.

I have not focussed much on validations due to time constraint, if more time available I could implement robust input and model validations.

Thank you for the opportunity.
