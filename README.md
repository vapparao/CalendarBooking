# TALTest

# Introduction
This Solution is a CalendarBooking Console Application. 
Through this solution the users can add booking, delete booking, find bookings and reserve booking with the respective commands

# My Feedback
I focused on making the solution function as per the requirements and I have used best practices in chosing packages and organizing code
I used
- Dependency Inversion Pattern for managing dependencies 
- Repository Pattern for data access
- Dapper light weight micro ORM for data access (CRUD)
- Used Serilog for effective logging
- Used Nodatime for datetime calculations

While I tested and made the functionalities work through debugging but less focus was made on finishing the unit tests due to time constraint, but
I have included my approach for writing unit tests with a test project and tests that further require time to make them pass

I have not focussed much on validating the inputs due to time constraint but could have been done effectively using custom model binder and validations

Thank you for the opportunity.
